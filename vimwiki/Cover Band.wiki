= Cover Band =

- I'm thinking we try for Black Strap first. It should be easier and much shorter set list.

- Let's try and learn these 4 songs and get together to rehearse it in a few weeks.

- Funeral Bell
- Mass Murder Machine
- Doomsday Jesus(I think we already learned this one so it should be easier)
- Crazy Horse

- Let me know what you guys think
