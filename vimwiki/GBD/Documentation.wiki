= Excel Notification Bars =
- https://github.com/GrowthByDesign/gbd-notification-bar
- this is for mulitple notification bars
- the content of the notification bars is in the app.js file
- from there the array named "notifications" contains objects that represent each notification bar
- there will you edit the objects to contain the text you need
- the primary text and secondary text contain the text content of the banner
- the primary text is the main header and larger text and the secondary is below that a little smaller
- sometimes you dont need on or the other so you can just comment them out
- the startDate and endDate keys outline the the start and end date of a notification bar, you will have to follow that date format
- the brandingPrimary and brandingAccent outline the colors of the notification bar
- brandingPrimary is the background color while the accent is the color of the bottom border
- app.js will generate the notification bars automatically so to transfer it over to the wordpress site you need a code block in the head of the site
- add all of the style.css content into the code block wrapped in a <style> tag. Dont include the * selector
- then you will put the entirety of the that file in the code block wrapped in a <script> tag
- thats it the notification bars will generate the html and css depending on the notification bar falls within the date rage specified.
- Also, if you need more bars at the same time just an object in the array with the same format and more will be added same for showing less

- inside the directory go to /app/(pages)/digital-branch/for-sale/data.ts
- here you will see every repo individually represented in its own object
- repos is an array of objects the function will map through to generate the code so you will only ever have to modify this file
- to remove repos simply the delete the whole object for that vehicle
- to add copy an object with the same format and replace the values with the new repo
- imgSrc is the url to the image
- the repo image is uploaded to media library on wordpress and then copy the url to place here
- the rest of the fields will populate the information for the rest of the repo
- once this file is correct with the new repo information you will need to "build" or generate the code
- from the terminal or command line inside this repo type "npm run dev"
- this spin up a server and show these files in a local host on your computer
- once the server is running go to http://localhost:3000/digital-branch/for-sale
- then inspect the page and the copy right click the div with the class "[content-section]" and then click copy and then copy element
- go to the live telco site and to for sale page
- then go to divi's wireframe mode and open the code block labeled "repo body"
- delete everything in there and paste what you copied from the local server
- the live site and your local server should now look the same
